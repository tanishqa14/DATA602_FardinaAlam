Q. Why are you interested in taking DATA602?
A. I want to develop a strong foundation in Data Science and apply to real-world scenarios. I want to master 3 stages of Data Science: Data analysis, Modelling and Data visualisation which will help me to solve or begin to solve literally any world problem with computational methods. This course has the potential to equip me with the right tools, hence I am interested in taking this course.
